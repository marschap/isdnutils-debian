iMON 1.0                                              (C) Michael Knigge, 1995
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Install iMON as follows:

1. copy imon.c and Makefile to your isdn4linux/tools directory. It's the
   same directory where isdnmon is located.

2. Edit the isdn4linux Makefile (_NOT_ the Makefile of iMON)!
   You have to change the line

   SUBDIRS=isdn icn teles
to
   SUBDIRS=isdn icn teles tools

3. Perhaps you have to add the directory where ncurses.h is located to
   the line

   export INCLUDES = ../include

   Than wite something line   

   export INCLUDES = ../include;/usr/include/ncurses



Thats all. Than type "make" in your isdn4linux directory. iMON should be
compiled without errors (there are 3 warnings I think). a "make install"
will install the binary "imon" to /sbin

READY

So, I hope this litte utility works as well for as it works for me. If

OPTIONS
-------

iMOM updates the screen every 5 seconds. You can override this default
value by typing

    imon -<time>     e.g. imon -2    will update the screen every 2 sec.
