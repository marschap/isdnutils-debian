imontty v 0.3
(c) 1995, Volker Goetz (volker@oops.franken.de)

This is version 0.3 of imontty, a handy program to print out the
status of all ISDN lines of the isdn4linux package.


INSTALLATION:
-------------

Check the Makefile for the correct path of the include directory
of the isdn4linux package:

ISDN_INCLUDE=/usr/src/isdn/include

is the default and fits if you have unpacked the isdn4linux
package in /usr/src.

SBINPATH must be set to the directory where the binary is going
to be installed.

To compile simply type "make" or "make all". If the compilation
stops with an error that isdnconfig.h could not be found then go
to the main directory of isdn4linux und type "make config" to
make the required include file. After that type again "make" or
"make all" in the imontty source directory.

To install the binary in its final location type "make install".


USAGE:
------

To print the status of the ISDN lines type "imontty". No command
line options are supported. The output should look like this:


ISDN channel status:

Channel #   Dr/Ch   Direction   Usage           Number
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Channel 0:  0/0     outgoing    IP interface    09317840724
Channel 1:  0/1     incoming    tty emulation   916188680


or (if two cards are installed):

ISDN channel status:

Channel #   Dr/Ch   Direction   Usage           Number
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Channel 0:  0/0     free        --              ???
Channel 1:  0/1     free        --              ???
Channel 2:  1/0     incoming    IP interface    933180724
Channel 3:  1/1     free        --              ???


One line describes the status of the named ISDN Channel.

Dr/Ch give the actual driver and channel of this driver which
are attached to this channel.

Direction: free, incoming or outgoing
Usage: raw device, tty emulation, IP interface, voice or fax.
Number is either the called partys number (outgoing) or the
calling party number (incoming). If the channel is unused (free)
"???" is printed.
