I have adapted tcpdump-3.0.3 for the new "rawip" internal packet format
(without header). I would be happy to see the diff included into the utils
package. It is a diff against the original tcpdump-3.0.3.tar.gz package,
as found f.e. under ftp.funet.fi:/pub/Linux/PEOPLE/Linus/net-source/tools/.

Cheers -e
