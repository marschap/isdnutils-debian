       ttyI, cui - ISDN character devices


</PRE>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
       <EM>ttyIx</EM> <EM>and</EM> <EM>cuix</EM> are the character devices of the isdn4linux
       ISND driver package.  They can be used in the same way  as
       the  traditional serial devices <EM>ttySx</EM> and <EM>cuax.</EM>  The offi-
       cial major device numbers are <EM>43</EM> for ttyI and <EM>44</EM> for  cui.
       The minor device numbers start with <EM>0</EM> and end with <EM>63.</EM>

       The  ISDN  devices provide a modem emulation with a set of
       traditional and some special AT  commands.  This  provides
       easy  use  together with almost all communication software
       that uses modem commands: <EM>minicom</EM>(1), <EM>seyon</EM>(1),  <EM>XCept</EM>(1),
       <EM>uucico</EM>(8)  (Taylor  UUCP),  <EM>mgetty</EM>(8), <EM>dip</EM>(8), <EM>pppd</EM>(8) and
       more.

       The line disciplines are handled by  the  kernel  so  that
       SLIP, CSLIP and asynchronous PPP are possible.

       The  port  speed  of  the <EM>ttyIx</EM> and <EM>cuix</EM> devices is always
       64000 bps.



</PRE>
<H2>AT COMMAND SET</H2><PRE>
       The following <EM>AT</EM> <EM>commands</EM> are supported by <EM>ttyIx</EM> and <EM>cuix.</EM>

       <STRONG>ATA</STRONG>     Answer an incoming call.

       <STRONG>ATD</STRONG> <STRONG>&lt;num&gt;</STRONG>
               Dial  number  &lt;num&gt;.  Allowed are digits [0-9] and
               the characters ",", "#", ".", "*", "W", "P",  "T",
               "S", "-". The characters are ignored except of "S"
               which indicates a SPV if it preceedes  the  number
               (<STRONG>only</STRONG> German 1TR6 ISDN).

       <STRONG>ATE0</STRONG>    Echo off.

       <STRONG>ATE1</STRONG>    Echo on (default).

       <STRONG>ATH</STRONG>     Hang up.

       <STRONG>ATH0</STRONG>    Hang up.

       <STRONG>ATH1</STRONG>    Off hook (ignored).

       <STRONG>ATI</STRONG>     Return device Information ("ISDN for Linux...").

       <STRONG>ATI0</STRONG>    Return device Information ("ISDN for Linux...").

       <STRONG>ATI1</STRONG>    Return device Information ("ISDN for Linux...").

       <STRONG>ATO</STRONG>     Return  from  command  mode  to  online mode (data

       <STRONG>ATQ1</STRONG>    Disable result codes.

       <STRONG>ATSx=y</STRONG>  Set register x to value y.

       <STRONG>ATSx?</STRONG>   Show content of register x.

       <STRONG>ATV0</STRONG>    Print result code as number.

       <STRONG>ATV1</STRONG>    Print result code as text (default).

       <STRONG>ATZ</STRONG>     Reset all registers and load profile values.

       <STRONG>AT&amp;Bx</STRONG>   Set packet size of outgoing  packets  to  value  x
               (maximum 4000).  The actual packet size depends on
               the hardware driver and may be  smaller  than  the
               given value x (e.g. with the teles driver).  There
               will be <STRONG>no</STRONG> error message if the  value  is  bigger
               than  the hardware driver can process. However the
               size of the outgoing  packets  will  be  set  cor-
               rectly.

       <STRONG>AT&amp;D2</STRONG>   DTR  falling  edge:  hang up and return to command
               mode (default).

       <STRONG>AT&amp;D3</STRONG>   DTR falling edge: hang up, return to command  mode
               and reset all registers.

       <STRONG>AT&amp;Ex</STRONG>   Set  MSN  (Euro-ISDN, E-DSS1) or EAZ (German 1TR6)
               to value x. For MSNs set x to the whole  MSN,  for
               EAZ's  x should be only the last digit of the Num-
               ber.

       <STRONG>AT&amp;F</STRONG>    Set  all  registers  and  profile   to   "factory-
               defaults".

       <STRONG>AT&amp;V</STRONG>    Show all settings.

       <STRONG>AT&amp;W0</STRONG>   Write  registers and EAZ/MSN to profile. (You need
               to run <EM>iprofd</EM>(8) for making changes permanent.)

       <STRONG>AT&amp;Xx</STRONG>   Enable (x=1) or disable (x=0) BTX-Mode.
