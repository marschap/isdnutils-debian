isdnutils for DEBIAN
--------------------

 - New upstream source. This version only works with the new ISDN kernel code,
   included in Linux 2.0.36 and (soon?) in 2.1.xxx.

 - Most of this package works in the same way to the previous (2.1beta1)
   version, expect that it is now split into different packages for
   convenience.
