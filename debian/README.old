isdnutils for DEBIAN
--------------------

 - tcltk script isdnmon was not included (obsoleted by isdnlog and isdnbutton).

 - vboxgetty is started via /etc/inittab. modify this file to activate
   vboxgetty. if you were using an old version of vbox, your old setup
   is still active. to change to new setup, you should edit /etc/inittab
   and then "update-rc.d vboxgetty remove" to delete the symlinks in
   /etc/rc[1-60].d, "/etc/init.d/vboxgetty stop" to stop the old
   vboxgetty and "init q" to start the new one from inittab.

 - the vbox tool mam was not included : i have no motif to compile it.
   the vbox tool xvboxled was replaced by the never version (now named
   xled). but it will not work unless you call it with
   "xled -vpath YOUR_PERSONAL_INCOMING_DIR_IN_VBOX_SPOOL"
   "xled -mail -mfile YOUR_MAIL_FILE"

about isdnlog
=============

 - no longer rotating logfiles on bootup, but daily.

 - isdnlog X11 client was not included : i have no motif to compile it.

 - NOTE: You have to set up the files /etc/isdnlog/isdnlog.conf,
   /etc/isdnlog/isdnlog.users, and /etc/init.d/isdnlog yourself!

about isdnbutton
================

 - is not suid root. so the menu function will not work. but you can
   enable them with suidregister, so anyone in group adm can use it.
   "suidregister /usr/X11R6/bin/isdnbutton root adm 4754" to register,
   "suidunregister /usr/X11R6/bin/isdnbutton" to unregister.

about ipppd
===========

 - uses /etc/ppp/options and other files. please install ppp for
   example option files.

about isdn kernel modules
=========================

 - please use the hisax device driver (kernel >= 2.0.30) and not the 
   old teles device driver. it's soo buggy.
