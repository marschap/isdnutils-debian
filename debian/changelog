    without it; it wasn't there on my own system either...)  Too bad m68k's
    build daemon also seems to be the slowest :(

  * Don't use 10.0.0.1 as default IP number in ipppd example (use

    perhaps some people only read the instructions on the second question :-)
    Unfortunately another part of bug 154836 ("upgrade should not restart the

    recorded message by email, thanks to Tobias Geiger. For now the script
    resides in /usr/share/doc/isdnvboxserver/vboxmail.enhanced, as it needs
    sox and mime-construct (and ideally an MP3 encoder), but I don't want to
    let isdnvboxserver depend on those. The user can copy this script to
    /etc/isdn/vboxmail .
  * isdneurofile: Added README.Debian to inform the user about necessary
    kernel options for this package.
  * ipppd: check whether running the init script gives errors. closes:#145883
  * ipppd: escape @ in login name when inserting into ipppd.ipppX file with
    perl, as perl otherwise interprets the @ as an array indicator.
    closes:#150230
  * isdnutils-xtools: prevent initial spike when starting xisdnload when the
    system has been online for some time. closes:#149392
  * isdnlog: added a logrotate.d entry for /var/log/isdn/isdnlog.
    closes:#148689
  * isdnutils-base: If a 3.0-something isdnutils postrm still exists, fix it
    so that purging isdnutils won't forcibly remove /etc/isdn, /var/lib/isdn
    etc.  This is a possible scenario if someone upgrades to isdnutils-base,
    ipppd by hand and then does dpkg --purge isdnutils. DAMHIKT. Modifying the
    old postinst is terrible, but it's the only viable option AFAICS.
  * isdnlog: added an option for starting isdnrate as a daemon. This is asked
    via debconf (priority low), and the actual control is in the file
    /etc/isdn/isdnrate.conf Also changed the default socket for isdnrate from
    /tmp/isdnrate to /var/run/isdnrate/socket.  closes:#144899
  * isdnlog: control file had two dependency lines, which resulted in only the
    last line being used, thus losing the dependency on isdnutils-base.

isdnutils (1:3.1pre4-4) unstable; urgency=high

  * Fixed ipppd debconf config file (typo, triggered whenever there's no

  * Fixed typo in capiutils.h (HAS_UINT8_t is now HAS_UINT8_T). Also include
    stdint.h conditionally (needed for the special types).  closes:#139460
  * Handle cron.weekly/isdnvbox script, which was the original isdnutils cron
    script which was renamed in early versions of 3.1pre1b, and NOT renamed
    when isdnvbox was split up :-(  If the md5sum is unchanged, it is deleted;
    if it is changed, a debconf message is shown. Same for
    cron.weekly/isdnutils for those cases where the upgrade from 3.0 is taking
    place.
  * Fixed handling of isdnvboxd password, to prevent special chars in it from
    messing up with the shell (i.e. escape certain characters with
    backslashes). This was the trigerr for report #139653
  * Modified vboxd.c so that DES-encrypted passwords (like what you may find
    in /etc/passwd) can be used in vboxd.conf. Passwords asked by debconf will
    then be crypted and put into the password field as "DES sszyxwvutsrqp".

isdnutils (1:3.1pre4-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * This also means new firmware code for Eicon active cards.
  * Added dependency on sox | nas-bin | alsautils instead of just a recommends
    for sox. closes:#135160
  * Also accept an empty string for the isdnvboxserver phonenumber to let the
    user do it by hand. closes:#126159
  * Make isdnvboxserver depend on debconf >= 0.5. closes:#137873
  * Build depends changed: sgml-tools -> linuxdoc-tools-text.  Grrrrrrr.
  * Check in isdnvboxserver debconf config that the homedir for the given
    daemon user exists. Check again in the postinst, and this time use the
    correct template to give the error message...
  * In ipppd debconf, also add question for local MSN (at priority medium).
  * Escape any quotes in the ipppd ISP password in ipppd.postinst
  * For some reason I moved isdnlog's pid file from /var/run/ to /var/lock/.
    /var/run of course is the correct location; there's also / already a
    lockfile for the device isdnlog uses in /var/lock/.
  * Change default isdnlog config file to say "daemon=yes", so that it will
    detach itself from the running tty (I would have thought that
    start-stop-daemon would have done that, by the way...)  Also added the
    -D option where isdnlog is started in /etc/isdn/init.d.functions to force
    the daemon mode, useful for existing installations.
    I thought I had done the change in the config file already, but I can't
    find any trace of it :-(
  * Split the German debconf translations into *.debconf.de
  * Added Dutch debconf translations, left them in *.debconf as I'm upstream
    for both the English and Dutch texts.
  * Added new French debconf translations thanks to Philippe Batailler

  * Added simple ISP configuration to debconf of ipppd, which just uses phone
    number, username and password. It creates and configures device.ippp0 and
    ipppd.ippp0 if they don't exist, and enters the password into pap-secrets

  * Fixed ipppd so that it doesn't insist on ioptions existing (even though

isdnutils (1:3.1pre1b-23) unstable; urgency=high

  * isdnutils finally made it to testing! Of course that means a new set of
    bad upgrading problems has been discovered (hence urgency=high).
  * There was no cleaner way of smoothly handling upgrades, so I've added a
    transitional package "isdnutils" that depends on the major component
    packages. What up to now (1:3.1pre1b-1 - 1:3.1pre1b-22) was known as
    isdnutils is now called isdnutils-base. Now to get the various depends /
    conflicts things right for the brave people who had already been tracking
    unstable, and already had 1:3.1pre1b installed...
    closes:#113021
  * When upgrading from 1:3.0-20, the test for ipppd doesn't work if you don't
    use dselect to upgrade; apt-get doesn't set the selection flag in dpkg's
    database. Grep debconf's config.dat for ipppd/ as a (dirty) workaround if
    ipppd isn't listed as to-be-installed by dpkg -l.
  * If the test for ipppd fails, restart the (old) isdnutils as the old
    prerm script stops them when upgrading. Someone will complain that they
    weren't running beforehand, but that's tough, sometimes a decision needs
    to be made. Hence that's at most a "won't fix" wishlist bug.
  * The postinst scripts for isdnutils and ipppd need a "db_stop" to prevent
    hanging after the daemons are started. They're only stopped and started
    when upgrading from pre-1:3.1pre1b ...
  * Ignore errors from "/etc/init.d/isdnutils start" in the isdnutils postinst
    as it will give an error also if the daemons are still/already running.
  * Depend on makedev, as apparently that isn't an essential package. Strange.
    closes:#112874
  * As this is now in isdnutils, the bug asking for the new version in testing
    can be closed: closes:#82082
  * Added a Depends: libcapi20 for pppdcapiplugin, as the plugin most
    certainly needs it.

isdnutils (1:3.1pre1b-22) unstable; urgency=low

  * Run 'libtoolize --force --copy' in capi20/ to satisfy powerpc. This
    apparently was needed suddenly (although nothing had changed in isdnutils).
  * Changed isdnlog-data's dependency on isdnlog to a recommends, as otherwise
    isdnlog-data is uninstallable on those arches where isdnlog isn't built.
    Why you would want to have isdnlog-data on those architectures anyway is a
    mystery to me, but that's the way the release management insists on having
    it. I hope that isdnutils now FINALLY makes it into "testing".
  * Changed isdnlog's relation to isdnlog-data to "Depends" instead of
    "Recommends" while I'm at it. Isdnlog won't work without the data.

isdnutils (1:3.1pre1b-19) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Set the linux/include/asm link correctly in the tree extracted from
    kernel-source package. This probably solves point 2 in the changelog entry
    for 1:3.1pre1b-17 (the kernel source needs to be configured first on
    powerpc), this apparently affected more than just powerpc. Strange,
    however, that the kernel source comes with the link preconfigured for i386
  * Only do the linux kernel source stuff on linux systems. Duh.
  * Changed build-depends kernel-source-2.2.19 -> kernel-source-2.4 to
    accomodate the new architectures.

  * Added ia64 to the list of architectures for all packages.
    It builds, so ship it :-)  Seriously, I see no reason why it shouldn't
    work.
  * Hacked a string in vbox/src/{log.c,vbox.c} that might be interpreted as a
    trigraph.  I hate trigraphs.
  * Added some #include <stdlib.h> to the cdb*.c files to declare exit() etc.
  * Fixed screwup in ipppd/auth.c related to dereferencing network IP number
    as a pointer to an uint32_t. Yuck. Also forwarded upstream to PPP people.
  * Fixed isdnlog/tools/dest/makedest so that it doesn't output line numbers
    while processing the data, if stdout is not a TTY. This saves space in
    the buildlog... Ditto for isdnlog/tools/zone/mkzonedb.c
  * Added a missing endpwent() call which caused isdnlog to keep /etc/passwd
    open. Also closed stdout, stderr in isdnlog while I was at it.
  * Solved a potential problem when the vbox password contained a comma, which
    conflicted with the perl stuff... Also made a note in the debconf template
    that : shouldn't be used (as that's the field separator in the file)
  * Added mips, mipsel to list of supported architectures, as it apparently
    builds fine. closes:#109210

isdnutils (1:3.1pre1b-17) unstable; urgency=high

  * Urgency high, as this fixes a grave bug (segv in pppd), and should
    allow it to (finally!) build on powerpc
  * Apparently the kernel source that's used needs to be configured first
    on powerpc, otherwise it will compile fine, but e.g. isdnctrl will use
    the wrong structs or so (at least, it can't access any data via ioctl).
    Thanks to Alain Schroeder <alain@parkautomat.net> for figuring this out.
  * Use gcc 3.0 on powerpc, otherwise the compiler segfaults when doing
    capi20. Also figured out by Alain.
  * symlink libcapi20.so to libcapi20.so.2 . closes:#108013
  * in xmonisdn/Makefile.in, build target xmonisdn.man before xmonisdn.
    Don't ask why; since XFree 4.1.0 this is needed?!

    to false in sid environment (not in testing, where it was always true!)
    closes:#107902
  * "FIRMWARE=$firmware" should have been "firmware=$firmware" in

  * In isdnutils.postinst, remove bogus "none," prefix from firmware value
    stored in debconf. This is caused by the wrong debconf template before
    version -11. Other part of 107842, hence: closes:#107842
  * Made the hisaxctrl manpage a bit clearer about devfs and firmware.

isdnutils (1:3.1pre1b-16) unstable; urgency=high

  * Filename for ippp device as passed to ipppd in init.d.functions didn't
    cope with devfs. closes:#107715
  * Dotting in a shell code fragment needs the file to either be in PATH or
    the filename to contain a slash. This is another one of those special
    features of ash that has been inflicted upon us. closes:#107745
  * Determining the linux source dir was screwed up for hurd.
  * Fixed instances of "echo -e"; now it's "/bin/echo -e" which always
    understands -e (ash's echo used to, now it doesn't; and it's not in
    POSIX).
  * Added powerpc again, as someone again managed to inflict some RC bugs on
    isdnutils preventing the previous version from entering testing. I've
    found that powerpc can't compile the capi20 code, so powerpc will have to
    do without all capi-related packages. The main stuff can go in though.
    BREAKING NEWS: according to Alain Schroeder <alain@parkautomat.net>, it
    compiles fine on powerpc when using gcc 3.0. He's volunteering to build
    the powerpc stuff for now, kudos to him!

isdnutils (1:3.1pre1b-15) unstable; urgency=high

  * Removed powerpc from architecture list, as apparently powerpc isn't able
    to compile isdnutils since end of 1999; and it's now holding up isdnutils
    from entering testing (which sucks). (The problem is a internal compiler
    error, hence not isdnutils' fault nor under isdnutils' control.)
  * Urgency "high", as the previous version was only held up by powerpc;
    no other problems nor no other changes, so I'd like isdnutils into
    testing ASAP.

  * Updated ipppd (auth.c) to current CVS:

  * Build failed to properly find / unpack kernel sources. The way that is done
    is now changed (and the link is made in the package source's top dir, not

    spool directory, i.e. using the name of the device as the dir name. This
    makes it all a bit more logical. This also means that the postinst has to
    check for all possible old situations, and try to clean it up.
  * Eek, isdnutils.postinst barfed with a dpkg-reconfigure due to 2 typos.
  * ipppd package now also asks the silly question.

isdnutils (1:3.1pre1b-12) unstable; urgency=low

  * Add silly question to isdnutils debconf whether it's allowed to create the
    ISDN devices. This to comply with the silly policy (see #106280).
    closes:#105620
  * Some people actually delete init.d scripts, figure that. Work around that
    for ipppd which uses init.d/isdnutils. closes:#106263
  * If /dev/isdninfo and /dev/isdn/isdninfo both don't exist (when accessed
    from /etc/isdn/init.d.functions) then it's probably a devfs system and no
    ISDN module is loaded. Detect this. closes:#100881
  * Changed 'text' to 'note', as instructed by Joey 'debconf' Hess.

isdnutils (1:3.1pre1b-11) unstable; urgency=low

  * Add arm and m68k to the architecture list, as it apparently builds fine
    there. closes:#105319
  * Call MAKEDEV also in ipppd.postinst, if isdninfo device entry doesn't
    exist. Or should ipppd predepend on isdnutils... closes:#100881
  * fixed mistake in generated firmware.conf scriptlet
    ($1 should be $# in -lt test) closes:#100750
  * Fixed template for isdnutils. Choices need to be separated by commas
    *AND* spaces; just commas doesn't work. I'm starting to hate debconf...
    This should also help to fix 100750 (see above)
  * dot-include /usr/share/debconf/confmodule at the top of the isdnutils
    postinst, as having that done later on by the #DEBHELPER# code fucks the
    system. closes:#100704
  * Priority reverted to 'extra' as only the "isdnutils" package is marked as
    "optional" in the overrides, all the other packages are "extra" ?! Only
    the isdnutils package itself is now "optional"...
  * updated config.guess and config.sub scripts in capi20/ and isdnlog/client/
    to satisfy simple-minded test by hppa build daemon (those parts aren't
    architecture: any and wouldn't be built anyway on hppa). closes:#105035
  * Added german translations to isdnlog.templates,
    courtesy of Sebastian Feltel <sebastian@feltel.de>. closes:#102095
  * Updated to latest CVS (isdnlog.h, divertctrl, FAQ). I patched divertctrl.c
    to accomodate 2.2 kernels during building.
  * Makefile for imontty now uses configured location of kernel include files.
    Ditto for {xmonisdn,xisdnload}/Makefile.in
  * Added "Replaces: isdnutils(<<1:3.1pre1b-0)" to isdnutils-xtools, ipppd,
    isdnlog, isdnvboxclient, isdnvboxserver, libcapi20, and isdnactivecards.
    This should prevent upgrade of isdnutils removing the newly installed
    /usr/sbin/ipppd (for example, most apparent example) which was installed
    when the new package ipppd was installed earlier...  Hopefully this should
    prevent a *lot* of very strange bug reports.

isdnutils (1:3.1pre1b-10) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixed (upstream) bug in isdnctrl which prevented dialout etc.
  * isdnutils: further debashified init.d.functions and device.DEVICE.
    closes:#95716
  * isdnutils: added support for loading of ISAR.BIN in isdnutils init.d
    script, and include ISAR.BIN in isdnutils package instead of
    isdnactivecards.  closes:#93403,#89885
  * isdnutils: check in postinst whether vboxgetty is configured into inittab,
    and if so, whether isdnvboxserver is installed. If not, then give a
    warning. This is part 1 of bug #84031. I hate bug reports with multiple
    hardly-related bugs in one.
  * isdnutils: enhanced the HOWTO with suggestions by Matthias Berse
    <matthias.berse@ruhr-uni-bochum.de> with guide on setting up a simple
    connection to the internet. Hopefully it's a little less confusing now.
    closes:#70852
  * isdnutils: added comments to device.DEVICE and HOWTO about default route
    also being set in /etc/ppp/ip-{up,down}.d/*-ipppd and how to avoid that
    if you don't want that feature.  closes:#66854
  * ipppd: "Suggest:" dnrd as that works fine with ipppd to provide support
    for dynamic DNS servers.
  * isdnvboxserver: offer the possibility of skipping debconf configuration
    for those that prefer to do it by hand (or who already have a working
    config from pre-debconf versions). This is part 2 of bug #84031
  * isdnvboxserver: chown the spooldir to the right user. (The client user
    was used, not the daemon user. The client user does not have to exist
    as a real user.) This is part 3 and the final part of bug #84031, so
    closes:#84031
  * isdnvboxserver: vbox examples weren't included in the package.
    closes:#98048
  * isdnvboxclient: replace /dev/fd/0 with - in vboxplay for aplay (which
    understands - to mean stdin, although that's not documented in the manpage)
    closes:#85455
  * isdnvboxclient: make vboxbeep sound more distinctive, and ignore filenames
    starting with '.'. Thanks to Norbert Nemec <nobbi@cheerful.com>.
    closes:#87771
  * Kernel 2.4 is supported already. closes:#72834
  * isdnutils-xtools: xmonisdn now runs the xmonisdn-netup and -netdown
    commands with a "start" and "stop" parameter, as per manpage. closes:#80951
  * Priority changed to 'optional' to agree with the overrides.
  * The build now longer needs the /proc/self/fd/0 hack for reading from stdin,
    the tools have been modified to understand "-". Apparently on ARM there is
    no /proc/self/fd/0 ?!

isdnutils (1:3.1pre1b-9) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixed build problems on big-endian systems. Hopefully it also functions
    correctly :-)  closes:#89361
  * Reverted to using supplied freecdb code instead of debian package.
  * Updated isdnctrl, isdnlog, pppdcapiplugin, FAQ to current CVS version
    (no other changes in CVS).
  * Screwed up with the kernel source package thing, so source wasn't available
    if not somewhere in /usr/src or /usr/local/src already. closes:#91921
  * Changed the /dev/fd/0 to /proc/self/fd/0 . Apparently /dev/fd/* aren't
    always available (it wasn't on my sparc, installed from the Official
    cdroms), and it seems to confuse the hell out of a lot of people (they
    think the floppy is used :-)
  * Removed cui reference from ttyI(4) manpage. closes:#99609
  * Fixed /etc/isdn/init.d.functions to handle starting isdnlog with devfs.
  * Ignore errors from 'killall vboxgetty' in isdnvboxserver postinst.
  * Upgrading now no longer stops (and starts) anything via the init.d script.
    closes:#81519
  * Hopefully, upgrading from old 3.0-20 version to the current split version
    where ipppd is a separate package will now warn if ipppd is configured but
    not selected as a package. closes:#81517
  * Build-Depends tcl-dev changed to tcl8.3-dev, as the virtual package tcl-dev
    seems to have all but disappeared. Also updated xlib6g-dev to xlibs-dev,
    and kernel-source-2.2.19. libxaw-dev and libreadline4-dev added.
  * upgraded standards-version to 3.5.5

isdnutils (1:3.1pre1b-5) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Fixed isdnrep to preserve the rest when called with -d. The old version
    deleted ALL data, yuck. Grave bug. closes:#83122
  * Separate pppdcapiplugin package (by popular request).
  * Changed ipppd.DEVICE example file, esp. the proxyarp line. closes:#69233
  * Fixed ipppd so that "noipx" option doesn't turn it ON. closes:#70416
  * Added "nohostroute" as option for ipppd yet again (sigh).
  * Fixed libcapi20 section (now in libs (of course)).
  * Updated most of it to the current CVS version.
  * Don't call hisaxctrl when starting isdnlog if cardid is capidrv-*
    (e.g.  with avmb1 module).
  * Added "MAKEDEV capi" to isdnactivecards.postinst.
  * Check for both /dev/isdninfo and /dev/isdn/isdninfo in init.d.functions,
    for devfs purposes. closes:#81368
  * Still got a bug report about isdnutils being installed without ipppd,
    despite the test in isdnutils.preinst. Now also look for ipppX interfaces
    (with netstat -i) in case people use non-standard isdn configs. Also added
    some debugging stuff in that script to help diagnose the problem when it
    goes wrong again.
  * Move the example scripts from /usr/share/doc/*/examples/default/ to
    /usr/share/isdn/default/ . closes:#85976
  * Fix init.d.functions to preserve any routes over a specific interface when
    adding a slave device to it (the interface had to be 'down" to add a slave,
    and that makes the kernel delete any routes that used that interface).
    closes:#85981
  * Run ipmasq (again) (if available) after configuring / deconfiguring the
    interfaces in the init script. closes:#69593
  * Check for old /etc/ppp/ip-{up,down}.d/{00,99}-isdnutils files, and either
    copy them to {00,99}-ipppd in the ipppd.preinst, or tell the user to check
    those files if {00,99}-ipppd already exist. Also nag in init.d.functions .
  * Replaced bashisms from /etc/isdn/init.d/functions.
  * Replaced some instances of tempnam() with more secure temp file usage.
  * Fixed having dh_installinit-supplied scripting added twice. Motto:
    don't use -ppackage when -a is already in effect.
  * Added manpage for vbox command.

isdnutils (1:3.1pre1b-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added experimental MPPP setup configuration (see README.MPPP).
  * Split off the capi20 library into libcapi20, as there are separate CAPI
    applications starting to turn up that need the capi20 libs for compilation
    and execution.
  * isdnactivecards init.d script had an error. closes:#77295
  * isdnutils preinstall checks whether ipppd config files exist and whether
    ipppd has been selected for installation, to prevent ipppd from
    disappearing while doing apt-get dist-upgrade. Something similar should
    probably be done for the other split-off packages, however ipppd is the
    most critical... (related to bug 65134)
  * update of isdn.conf didn't go right when upgrading from 3.0. 
  * Don't include the old isdn.conf example in doc/isdnlog/examples/default/
    anymore, the other ones from upstream are better nowadays.
  * Fetch defaults for debconf in isdnlog from current isdn.conf if it exists.
  * isdnvboxclient now is for any architecture, as it doesn't depend on ISDN
    hardware. Also don't make it depend on isdnutils; suggestion from
    dungeon.inka.de (Andreas Jellinghaus)
  * As there are now separate packages, one of which is for X utilities,
    this closes:#46433,#61831
  * Fix vbox documentation. Also noticed example/vboxd.conf wasn't being
    included in the (now) isdnvboxserver package, and example/vborxrc not in
    isdnvboxclient; oops... closes:#63700
  * Commenting out the "not configured" line in device.i* now also works, for
    those people who can't read instructions :-) closes:#70815
  * Updated rate-nl.dat and rate-de.dat
  * Removed old postinst stuff from original isdnutils from isdnutils-doc
    postinst.

isdnutils (1:3.1pre1b-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * First upload to unstable of the new isdnutils, after residing in
    experimental for a number of weeks. Most of the obvious bugs should
    be fixed now... Time for a larger audience to find the less obvious
    bugs :-)
  * capiinit now searches the correct directory for the firmware.
  * isdnactivecards now has a separate init.d script.
  * isdnvboxserver postinst could terminate due to exit code 30 from
    debconf, hopefully fixed now.

isdnutils (1:3.1pre1b-2) experimental; urgency=low

  * based on newest CVS version (2000-09-14). Now includes isdncause script.
  * Fixed up the control file, such as depends etc. and the sections.
  * Split isdnvbox into a server and a client part (isdnvboxserver and
    isdnvboxclient). An isdnvbox package remains for the time being that
    depends on both parts. This will go away when this stuff moves out of
    experimental.
  * First debconf attempt for isdnvboxserver.
  * Mark as conffiles /etc/isdn/vbox*
  * vbox messagefiles now are written with .vmsg extension, to facilitate
    handling via MIME.
  * default location for vbox.conf is now ~user/.vbox.conf instead of
    /var/spool/vbox/user/vbox.conf
  * Changed configuration to include capiinit (for isdnactivecards). This was
    missing in the previous versions...
  * Build-depend on tcl-dev instead of tcl8.0-dev|tcl8.2-dev|tcl8.3-dev ...
  * Fixed doc-base files.
  * Removed Yahoo Online from isdn.conf.de, apparently not usable anymore.
  * Fixed a lot of little things already reported as bugs. Not closing now,
    as this is still destined for experimental. The bugs that would be closed
    are 65056, 65059, 65060, 65061, 65065 (Thanks for all these reports Joey :)

isdnutils (1:3.1pre1b-1.1) experimental; urgency=low

  * test version only, only official upload (hence the "NMU" number).
  * I've taken the newest upstream CVS version again, which included quite a
    lot of what was in isdnutils_3.1pre1b-1.diff.gz .
  * Fixed dependencies (I had forgotten the epoch)
  * Fixed isdnconfig to get its default files from the right places;
    also removed isdnlog stuff from it as isdnlog has its own debconf
    stuff now.
  * Re-implemented some "smart" stuff in vboxmail and vboxplay that I had
    added in the 3.0 series of isdnutils.

isdnutils (1:3.1pre1b-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * New upstream sources (CVS of 2000/08/01)
  * Completely new packaging, now based on debhelper. So expect bugs for the
    first couple of versions while fixes made in the old version slowly get
    reimplemented :-)
  * Split into different packages. This helps those e.g. who don't need/want
    the X libs installed, and is also a must now there are megabytes of
    country-specific data for isdnlog.
  * isdnlog should now be country-independent! World premiere of this code :-)
    (Before, isdnlog was compile-time configured for a country.)
  * First attempt at adding debconf support as well. isdnlog is fairly complete,
    ipppd should have a debconf thing to create ippp0 config.
