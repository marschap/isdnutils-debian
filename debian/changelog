    Unfortunately another part of bug 154836 ("upgrade should not restart the

isdnutils (1:3.1pre4-5) unstable; urgency=low

  * Updated to CVS version of 2002-07-04
  * ipppd: applied patch supplied by Emmanuel Charpentier, which backports the
    MS-CHAP implementation from pppd-2.4.1 to ipppd. This means ipppd now also
    supports MS-CHAP without the need for libdes.
  * isdnvboxserver: when creating the spool directory, also create the
    necessary subdirectories and copy the standard.tcl there. This is
    necessary for operation...
  * isdnvboxserver: new and improved vboxmail script, now optionally sends the
    recorded message by email, thanks to Tobias Geiger. For now the script
    resides in /usr/share/doc/isdnvboxserver/vboxmail.enhanced, as it needs
    sox and mime-construct (and ideally an MP3 encoder), but I don't want to
    let isdnvboxserver depend on those. The user can copy this script to
    /etc/isdn/vboxmail .
  * isdneurofile: Added README.Debian to inform the user about necessary
    kernel options for this package.
  * ipppd: check whether running the init script gives errors. closes:#145883
  * ipppd: escape @ in login name when inserting into ipppd.ipppX file with
    perl, as perl otherwise interprets the @ as an array indicator.

  * isdnutils-xtools: prevent initial spike when starting xisdnload when the
    system has been online for some time. closes:#149392
  * isdnlog: added a logrotate.d entry for /var/log/isdn/isdnlog.
    closes:#148689
  * isdnutils-base: If a 3.0-something isdnutils postrm still exists, fix it
    so that purging isdnutils won't forcibly remove /etc/isdn, /var/lib/isdn
    etc.  This is a possible scenario if someone upgrades to isdnutils-base,
    ipppd by hand and then does dpkg --purge isdnutils. DAMHIKT. Modifying the
    old postinst is terrible, but it's the only viable option AFAICS.
  * isdnlog: added an option for starting isdnrate as a daemon. This is asked
    via debconf (priority low), and the actual control is in the file
    /etc/isdn/isdnrate.conf Also changed the default socket for isdnrate from
    /tmp/isdnrate to /var/run/isdnrate/socket.  closes:#144899

    place.
  * Fixed handling of isdnvboxd password, to prevent special chars in it from
    messing up with the shell (i.e. escape certain characters with
    backslashes). This was the trigerr for report #139653
  * Modified vboxd.c so that DES-encrypted passwords (like what you may find

  * Escape any quotes in the ipppd ISP password in ipppd.postinst
  * For some reason I moved isdnlog's pid file from /var/run/ to /var/lock/.
    /var/run of course is the correct location; there's also / already a
    lockfile for the device isdnlog uses in /var/lock/.
  * Change default isdnlog config file to say "daemon=yes", so that it will
    detach itself from the running tty (I would have thought that
    start-stop-daemon would have done that, by the way...)  Also added the
    -D option where isdnlog is started in /etc/isdn/init.d.functions to force
    the daemon mode, useful for existing installations.
    I thought I had done the change in the config file already, but I can't
    find any trace of it :-(

isdnutils (1:3.1pre1b-23) unstable; urgency=high

  * isdnutils finally made it to testing! Of course that means a new set of
    bad upgrading problems has been discovered (hence urgency=high).
  * There was no cleaner way of smoothly handling upgrades, so I've added a
    transitional package "isdnutils" that depends on the major component
    packages. What up to now (1:3.1pre1b-1 - 1:3.1pre1b-22) was known as
    isdnutils is now called isdnutils-base. Now to get the various depends /
    conflicts things right for the brave people who had already been tracking
    unstable, and already had 1:3.1pre1b installed...
    closes:#113021
  * When upgrading from 1:3.0-20, the test for ipppd doesn't work if you don't
    use dselect to upgrade; apt-get doesn't set the selection flag in dpkg's
    database. Grep debconf's config.dat for ipppd/ as a (dirty) workaround if
    ipppd isn't listed as to-be-installed by dpkg -l.
  * If the test for ipppd fails, restart the (old) isdnutils as the old
    prerm script stops them when upgrading. Someone will complain that they
    weren't running beforehand, but that's tough, sometimes a decision needs
    to be made. Hence that's at most a "won't fix" wishlist bug.
  * The postinst scripts for isdnutils and ipppd need a "db_stop" to prevent
    hanging after the daemons are started. They're only stopped and started
    when upgrading from pre-1:3.1pre1b ...
  * Ignore errors from "/etc/init.d/isdnutils start" in the isdnutils postinst
    as it will give an error also if the daemons are still/already running.
  * Depend on makedev, as apparently that isn't an essential package. Strange.
    closes:#112874
  * As this is now in isdnutils, the bug asking for the new version in testing
    can be closed: closes:#82082
  * Added a Depends: libcapi20 for pppdcapiplugin, as the plugin most
    certainly needs it.

isdnutils (1:3.1pre1b-22) unstable; urgency=low

  * Run 'libtoolize --force --copy' in capi20/ to satisfy powerpc. This
    apparently was needed suddenly (although nothing had changed in isdnutils).
  * Changed isdnlog-data's dependency on isdnlog to a recommends, as otherwise
    isdnlog-data is uninstallable on those arches where isdnlog isn't built.
    Why you would want to have isdnlog-data on those architectures anyway is a
    mystery to me, but that's the way the release management insists on having
    it. I hope that isdnutils now FINALLY makes it into "testing".
  * Changed isdnlog's relation to isdnlog-data to "Depends" instead of
    "Recommends" while I'm at it. Isdnlog won't work without the data.

isdnutils (1:3.1pre1b-19) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Set the linux/include/asm link correctly in the tree extracted from
    kernel-source package. This probably solves point 2 in the changelog entry
    for 1:3.1pre1b-17 (the kernel source needs to be configured first on
    powerpc), this apparently affected more than just powerpc. Strange,
    however, that the kernel source comes with the link preconfigured for i386
  * Only do the linux kernel source stuff on linux systems. Duh.
  * Changed build-depends kernel-source-2.2.19 -> kernel-source-2.4 to
    accomodate the new architectures.
  * Fixed imon for devfs. closes:#109609

isdnutils (1:3.1pre1b-18) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added ia64 to the list of architectures for all packages.
    It builds, so ship it :-)  Seriously, I see no reason why it shouldn't
    work.
  * Hacked a string in vbox/src/{log.c,vbox.c} that might be interpreted as a
    trigraph.  I hate trigraphs.
  * Added some #include <stdlib.h> to the cdb*.c files to declare exit() etc.
  * Fixed screwup in ipppd/auth.c related to dereferencing network IP number
    as a pointer to an uint32_t. Yuck. Also forwarded upstream to PPP people.
  * Fixed isdnlog/tools/dest/makedest so that it doesn't output line numbers
    while processing the data, if stdout is not a TTY. This saves space in
    the buildlog... Ditto for isdnlog/tools/zone/mkzonedb.c
  * Added a missing endpwent() call which caused isdnlog to keep /etc/passwd
    open. Also closed stdout, stderr in isdnlog while I was at it.
  * Solved a potential problem when the vbox password contained a comma, which
    conflicted with the perl stuff... Also made a note in the debconf template
    that : shouldn't be used (as that's the field separator in the file)
  * Added mips, mipsel to list of supported architectures, as it apparently
    builds fine. closes:#109210
  * Updated rate-nl.dat to reflect new NL rates (duh)

isdnutils (1:3.1pre1b-17) unstable; urgency=high

  * Urgency high, as this fixes a grave bug (segv in pppd), and should
    allow it to (finally!) build on powerpc
  * Apparently the kernel source that's used needs to be configured first
    on powerpc, otherwise it will compile fine, but e.g. isdnctrl will use
    the wrong structs or so (at least, it can't access any data via ioctl).
    Thanks to Alain Schroeder <alain@parkautomat.net> for figuring this out.
  * Use gcc 3.0 on powerpc, otherwise the compiler segfaults when doing
    capi20. Also figured out by Alain.
  * symlink libcapi20.so to libcapi20.so.2 . closes:#108013
  * in xmonisdn/Makefile.in, build target xmonisdn.man before xmonisdn.
    Don't ask why; since XFree 4.1.0 this is needed?!
    Also removed if statement from rules, as that somehow always was evaluated
    to false in sid environment (not in testing, where it was always true!)
    closes:#107902
  * "FIRMWARE=$firmware" should have been "firmware=$firmware" in
    isdnutils.postinst . Now it is. Also move firmware.conf out of the way if
    debconf now tells us there's no firmware to be loaded. Partly bug #107842
  * In isdnutils.postinst, remove bogus "none," prefix from firmware value
    stored in debconf. This is caused by the wrong debconf template before
    version -11. Other part of 107842, hence: closes:#107842
  * Made the hisaxctrl manpage a bit clearer about devfs and firmware.
  * Enclosed the $oldpwd in   cd $oldpwd   in quotes (in init.d.functions),
    otherwise the cd fails when $oldpwd contains spaces. Sigh...

isdnutils (1:3.1pre1b-16) unstable; urgency=high

  * Urgency high, as this fixes two important bugs (ash and devfs related).
  * Filename for ippp device as passed to ipppd in init.d.functions didn't
    cope with devfs. closes:#107715
  * Dotting in a shell code fragment needs the file to either be in PATH or
    the filename to contain a slash. This is another one of those special
    features of ash that has been inflicted upon us. closes:#107745
  * Determining the linux source dir was screwed up for hurd.
  * Fixed instances of "echo -e"; now it's "/bin/echo -e" which always
    understands -e (ash's echo used to, now it doesn't; and it's not in
    POSIX).
  * Added powerpc again, as someone again managed to inflict some RC bugs on
    isdnutils preventing the previous version from entering testing. I've
    found that powerpc can't compile the capi20 code, so powerpc will have to
    do without all capi-related packages. The main stuff can go in though.
    BREAKING NEWS: according to Alain Schroeder <alain@parkautomat.net>, it
    compiles fine on powerpc when using gcc 3.0. He's volunteering to build
    the powerpc stuff for now, kudos to him!

isdnutils (1:3.1pre1b-15) unstable; urgency=high

  * Removed powerpc from architecture list, as apparently powerpc isn't able
    to compile isdnutils since end of 1999; and it's now holding up isdnutils
    from entering testing (which sucks). (The problem is a internal compiler
    error, hence not isdnutils' fault nor under isdnutils' control.)
  * Urgency "high", as the previous version was only held up by powerpc;
    no other problems nor no other changes, so I'd like isdnutils into
    testing ASAP.

isdnutils (1:3.1pre1b-14) unstable; urgency=low

    'with the persit option enabled, the pppd will not reset the errorcode
     variable "status" resulting in a disconnect immediatly after trying to
     setup the connection'
  * Updated ipppd (auth.c) to current CVS:
    'loop never executed - this was the reason that droping a slave could
     remove the complete ip setup'
  * Build failed to properly find / unpack kernel sources. The way that is done
    is now changed (and the link is made in the package source's top dir, not
    in the parent dir). If the kernel source link is not properly made, the
    build should stop at once, instead of limping along...  closes:#106713
  * Install a symlink from vboxcnvt to rmdtovbox as well (the rmdtovbox manpage
    was installed, but not the executable).
  * debug message "End of audio data" now doesn't print the errno message by
    default; now only when necessary.

  * Restructured the isdnvboxserver.config debconf script. It did Bad Things
    in some cases. Also rearranged isdnvboxserver.postinst a bit for this.
    closes:#106516
  * isdnvboxserver will now always configure /var/spool/vbox/ttyI* as the
    spool directory, i.e. using the name of the device as the dir name. This
    makes it all a bit more logical. This also means that the postinst has to
    check for all possible old situations, and try to clean it up.
  * Eek, isdnutils.postinst barfed with a dpkg-reconfigure due to 2 typos.
  * ipppd package now also asks the silly question.

  * Call MAKEDEV also in ipppd.postinst, if isdninfo device entry doesn't
    exist. Or should ipppd predepend on isdnutils... closes:#100881
  * fixed mistake in generated firmware.conf scriptlet
    ($1 should be $# in -lt test) closes:#100750
  * Fixed template for isdnutils. Choices need to be separated by commas
    *AND* spaces; just commas doesn't work. I'm starting to hate debconf...
    This should also help to fix 100750 (see above)
  * dot-include /usr/share/debconf/confmodule at the top of the isdnutils
    postinst, as having that done later on by the #DEBHELPER# code fucks the
    system. closes:#100704
  * Priority reverted to 'extra' as only the "isdnutils" package is marked as
    "optional" in the overrides, all the other packages are "extra" ?! Only
    the isdnutils package itself is now "optional"...
  * updated config.guess and config.sub scripts in capi20/ and isdnlog/client/
    to satisfy simple-minded test by hppa build daemon (those parts aren't
    architecture: any and wouldn't be built anyway on hppa). closes:#105035
  * Added german translations to isdnlog.templates,
    courtesy of Sebastian Feltel <sebastian@feltel.de>. closes:#102095
  * Updated to latest CVS (isdnlog.h, divertctrl, FAQ). I patched divertctrl.c
    to accomodate 2.2 kernels during building.
  * Makefile for imontty now uses configured location of kernel include files.
    Ditto for {xmonisdn,xisdnload}/Makefile.in
  * Added "Replaces: isdnutils(<<1:3.1pre1b-0)" to isdnutils-xtools, ipppd,
    isdnlog, isdnvboxclient, isdnvboxserver, libcapi20, and isdnactivecards.
    This should prevent upgrade of isdnutils removing the newly installed
    /usr/sbin/ipppd (for example, most apparent example) which was installed
    when the new package ipppd was installed earlier...  Hopefully this should
    prevent a *lot* of very strange bug reports.

  * isdnutils: check in postinst whether vboxgetty is configured into inittab,

    config from pre-debconf versions). This is part 2 of bug #84031
  * isdnvboxserver: chown the spooldir to the right user. (The client user

    those files if {00,99}-ipppd already exist. Also nag in init.d.functions .
  * Replaced bashisms from /etc/isdn/init.d/functions.
  * Replaced some instances of tempnam() with more secure temp file usage.

    reimplemented :-)
  * Split into different packages. This helps those e.g. who don't need/want
    the X libs installed, and is also a must now there are megabytes of
    country-specific data for isdnlog.
  * isdnlog should now be country-independent! World premiere of this code :-)
