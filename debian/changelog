isdnutils (1:2.1.beta1-22) unstable; urgency=low

    on Alpha.

 -- Paul Slootman <paul@debian.org>  Wed, 27 May 1998 20:24:00 +0200

isdnutils (1:2.1.beta1-21) unstable; urgency=low

  * isdnlog bugfix for international calls to USA (countrycode 1 digit long)
  * isdnrep now also pays attention to the "cityweekend=y" option.
  * "cityweekend" option documented in the isdnlog manpage.
  * isdnlog "outfile" may now begin with "+" to indicate that isdnlog must
    append data to an existing file instead of truncating it when opening it
  * (source change only) building with ms-chap enabled now works
  * added /etc/isdn/net{up,down} to conffiles
  * now suggest mgetty; mgetty is used in example inittab entry for X.75 login
  * changed device.* file to make configuration thereof easier (hopefully)
  * fixed ipfwadm examples (in device.* and /etc/ppp/ip-*.d/isdnutils) so that
    there is a better chance that they will work (at least better than first)
  * /etc/ppp/ip-down.d/isdnutils now sets the default route to the interface
    instead of deleting it. The latter is safer (no unexpected dialout
    sessions) but generated complaints, as that was not expected.
  * isdnctrl manpage is better (synced with upstream version)

  * ipppd pidfile now has correct name (/dev/ is now stripped off).
  * Fixed copyright speling misteak (thanks, Lintian).
  * The following changes were in -19 but somehow didn't get into the changelog:
    - Fixed ipppd messages about "bad file descriptor" when ip-up or
      ip-down doesn't exist (from upstream CVS version).
    - Added isdnlog and ipppd to the "Replaces" field so that an automatic
      upgrade with dselect is possible. fixes: #17018
    - Added IP dynamic address hack to device.DEVICE script if kernel version
      is greater than 2.0.30 (i.e. if /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_dynaddr exists).

  * sources brought into sync with CVS development version where possible.

    protocol.
  * isdnlog patched to prevent crashes under certain buffer conditions (it was
    assumed that BUFSIZ == 1024, and glibc has BUFSIZ == 8192)
  * /usr/doc/isdnutils/examples/default/* remain compressed (else md5sums is
    not in sync, and lintian complains). Isdnconfig was changed to handle this.
  * init.d script referred to Readme.debian and CONFIG, which were actually
    called README.debian and CONFIG.gz.
  * isdn.conf now has correct CODELIB= and AREALIB= entries. Also fixed
    unescaped $ signs in START definitions.
  * reworked the CONFIG file a bit.
  * cron.weekly script is a bit more robust.
  * Example ip-up.d and ip-down.d scripts are now only installed if ipppd is
    selected during isdnconfig; the scripts have some more examples in them.
