isdnutils (1:3.1pre4-4) unstable; urgency=high

  * Fixed ipppd debconf config file (typo, triggered whenever there's no
    interface configured yet, which screws it up for fresh installs, hence the
    urgency: high, as I don't want the bad version to be released with woody.
    No other significant changes made...  closes:#144414
  * Updated Catalan translations.         closes:#142785,#142786
  * Updated descriptions (fix mistakes).  closes:#142690

  * Make it configurable what ippp interface is configured by debconf, this
    time properly. Argh.

isdnutils (1:3.1pre4-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixed typo in capiutils.h (HAS_UINT8_t is now HAS_UINT8_T). Also include
    stdint.h conditionally (needed for the special types).  closes:#139460
  * Handle cron.weekly/isdnvbox script, which was the original isdnutils cron
    script which was renamed in early versions of 3.1pre1b, and NOT renamed
    when isdnvbox was split up :-(  If the md5sum is unchanged, it is deleted;
    if it is changed, a debconf message is shown. Same for
    cron.weekly/isdnutils for those cases where the upgrade from 3.0 is taking
    place.
  * Fixed handling of isdnvboxd password, to prevent special chars in it from
    messing up with the shell (i.e. escape certain characters with
    backslashes). This was the trigerr for report #139653
  * Modified vboxd.c so that DES-encrypted passwords (like what you may find
    in /etc/passwd) can be used in vboxd.conf. Passwords asked by debconf will
    then be crypted and put into the password field as "DES sszyxwvutsrqp".
    closes:#139653
  * Added Catalan translations (wow), thanks to Antoni Bella
    <bella5@teleline.es>. closes:#140197,#140198,#140199,#140200
  * Updated French translations. closes:#140382
  * Make it configurable what ippp interface is configured by debconf.
    closes:#135761
  * Only reset the default route in the ip-down.d script if the default route
    is over "this" interface. closes:#139702
  * Depend on at least version 2.3.1-58 of makedev. closes:#141163
  * Updated KPN rates for NL
  * Wrote manpages for divaload, divalog, divalogd, mkzonedb, eftp, eftd,
    capifax, capifaxrcvd, rcapid, capiinit.  Pfff....

isdnutils (1:3.1pre4-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New (sort of) upstream version.
  * This also means new firmware code for Eicon active cards.
  * Added dependency on sox | nas-bin | alsautils instead of just a recommends
    for sox. closes:#135160
  * Also accept an empty string for the isdnvboxserver phonenumber to let the
    user do it by hand. closes:#126159
  * Make isdnvboxserver depend on debconf >= 0.5. closes:#137873
  * Build depends changed: sgml-tools -> linuxdoc-tools-text.  Grrrrrrr.
  * Check in isdnvboxserver debconf config that the homedir for the given
    daemon user exists. Check again in the postinst, and this time use the
    correct template to give the error message...
  * In ipppd debconf, also add question for local MSN (at priority medium).
  * Escape any quotes in the ipppd ISP password in ipppd.postinst
  * For some reason I moved isdnlog's pid file from /var/run/ to /var/lock/.
    /var/run of course is the correct location; there's also / already a
    lockfile for the device isdnlog uses in /var/lock/.
  * Change default isdnlog config file to say "daemon=yes", so that it will
    detach itself from the running tty (I would have thought that
    start-stop-daemon would have done that, by the way...)  Also added the
    -D option where isdnlog is started in /etc/isdn/init.d.functions to force
    the daemon mode, useful for existing installations.
    I thought I had done the change in the config file already, but I can't
    find any trace of it :-(
  * Split the German debconf translations into *.debconf.de
  * Added Dutch debconf translations, left them in *.debconf as I'm upstream
    for both the English and Dutch texts.
  * Added new French debconf translations thanks to Philippe Batailler
    <pbatailler@teaser.fr>. closes:#139277
  * Removed a space from a couple of echoes for cosmetic reasons in the init.d
    script. closes:#139376

isdnutils (1:3.1pre1b-30) unstable; urgency=low

  * Split off part of the moving around etc. of files in the install phase of
    debian/rules. This makes it easier to handle the situation where on
    architectures without isdn4linux hardware support, only isdnvboxclient is
    built.
  * Add xisdnload app-defaults to list of conffiles. (No bug was reported :-)
    Also added a preinst and postinst to preserve the existing add-defaults.
    Hmm, waited too long with the upload, some smartass submitted a bug after
    all, also for isdneurofile, pppdcapiplugin. closes:#132807,#132809,#132816
  * Changed cisco_h and cisco_hk to cisco-h and cisco-hk respectively in the
    isdnctrl(8) manpage. Also modified isdnctrl(8) so that it will accept
    cisco_h and cisco_hk as aliases for cisco-h and cisco-hk. closes:#132723

  * Remove bogus reference to /etc/init.d/isdnlog in comment(!) from
    /etc/init.d/isdnutils. closes:#126132

isdnutils (1:3.1pre1b-27) unstable; urgency=low

  * Updated isdnutils-base HOWTO (debian.org link fixed),
    and README.Debian reinstated.  closes:#118688
  * Minor README fix for pppdcapiplugin. Also committed to upstream version.
    closes:#118689
  * Added German parts to the isdnutils-base template file, courtesy of
    Sebastian Feltel <sebastian at feltel.de>.   closes:#118957
  * Added simple ISP configuration to debconf of ipppd, which just uses phone
    number, username and password. It creates and configures device.ippp0 and
    ipppd.ippp0 if they don't exist, and enters the password into pap-secrets
    and chap-secrets. This should be enough for most ISPs.
  * Made the isdnutils.postinst script a bit more robust. closes:#119625
  * Fixed D-channel logging for isdnlog with more than one card.
    init.d.functions was updated for this.  closes:#121609
  * Changed default ringtimeout for vboxgetty in the code to 6 seconds.
    vboxgetty now also checks for a sane value of ringtimeout as set in the

isdnutils (1:3.1pre1b-26) unstable; urgency=low

  * When starting a device (interface), first check whether the interface
    happens to already exist; if so, try to stop it first. However,
    don't consider failure to start a device (interface) a fatal error;
    give a warning instead and carry on. closes:#115542
  * When ipppd checks for PPP availability, now check all devices given as
    options until one is found where the test succeeds; otherwise, if a slave
    device name is given first, the test would fail. closes:#116094
  * Fixed ipppd so that it doesn't insist on ioptions existing (even though
    it's recommended that that file shouldn't be used in the docs, which was a
    confusing situation).
  * isdnlog tries to log to a file in /var/lib/isdn/ by default, but that
    directory wasn't included in the .deb. Thanks to Philipp Kamps for
    pointing this out.
  * Updated source to current (20011025) CVS version:
    - FAQ
    - capiinfo manpage
    - capiplugin
    - isdnlog rate-de.dat, isdnlog SQL output, zonefile generation,
      CDB fix.

    closes:#114870
  * Add a default rate.conf for isdnlog, for those countries that

    zone-default.cdb is created.

  * Changed priority of debconf questions for isdnvboxserver daemonuser to
    critical, as this absolutely needs to be edited.
  * Be less verbose when reloading daemons (in /etc/init.d/isdnutils)
  * Tried to make isdnvboxserver.postinst a bit more idiotproof. Also force

isdnutils (1:3.1pre1b-23) unstable; urgency=high

  * isdnutils finally made it to testing! Of course that means a new set of
    bad upgrading problems has been discovered (hence urgency=high).
  * There was no cleaner way of smoothly handling upgrades, so I've added a
    transitional package "isdnutils" that depends on the major component
    packages. What up to now (1:3.1pre1b-1 - 1:3.1pre1b-22) was known as
    isdnutils is now called isdnutils-base. Now to get the various depends /
    conflicts things right for the brave people who had already been tracking
    unstable, and already had 1:3.1pre1b installed...
    closes:#113021
  * When upgrading from 1:3.0-20, the test for ipppd doesn't work if you don't
    use dselect to upgrade; apt-get doesn't set the selection flag in dpkg's
    database. Grep debconf's config.dat for ipppd/ as a (dirty) workaround if
    ipppd isn't listed as to-be-installed by dpkg -l.
  * If the test for ipppd fails, restart the (old) isdnutils as the old
    prerm script stops them when upgrading. Someone will complain that they
    weren't running beforehand, but that's tough, sometimes a decision needs
    to be made. Hence that's at most a "won't fix" wishlist bug.
  * The postinst scripts for isdnutils and ipppd need a "db_stop" to prevent
    hanging after the daemons are started. They're only stopped and started
    when upgrading from pre-1:3.1pre1b ...
  * Ignore errors from "/etc/init.d/isdnutils start" in the isdnutils postinst
    as it will give an error also if the daemons are still/already running.
  * Depend on makedev, as apparently that isn't an essential package. Strange.
    closes:#112874
  * As this is now in isdnutils, the bug asking for the new version in testing
    can be closed: closes:#82082
  * Added a Depends: libcapi20 for pppdcapiplugin, as the plugin most
    certainly needs it.

isdnutils (1:3.1pre1b-22) unstable; urgency=low

  * Run 'libtoolize --force --copy' in capi20/ to satisfy powerpc. This
    apparently was needed suddenly (although nothing had changed in isdnutils).
  * Changed isdnlog-data's dependency on isdnlog to a recommends, as otherwise
    isdnlog-data is uninstallable on those arches where isdnlog isn't built.
    Why you would want to have isdnlog-data on those architectures anyway is a
    mystery to me, but that's the way the release management insists on having
    it. I hope that isdnutils now FINALLY makes it into "testing".
  * Changed isdnlog's relation to isdnlog-data to "Depends" instead of
    "Recommends" while I'm at it. Isdnlog won't work without the data.

isdnutils (1:3.1pre1b-20) unstable; urgency=low

  * isdnlog install target would try to append to /etc/services if no entry
    for "isdnlog" was found. Normally not a problem, with a chrooted build
    daemon it is. Now make sure it's relative to $DESTDIR. closes:#110355

    warning about this is given instead ("you need the ipppd package").

isdnutils (1:3.1pre1b-19) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Set the linux/include/asm link correctly in the tree extracted from
    kernel-source package. This probably solves point 2 in the changelog entry
    for 1:3.1pre1b-17 (the kernel source needs to be configured first on
    powerpc), this apparently affected more than just powerpc. Strange,
    however, that the kernel source comes with the link preconfigured for i386
  * Only do the linux kernel source stuff on linux systems. Duh.
  * Changed build-depends kernel-source-2.2.19 -> kernel-source-2.4 to
    accomodate the new architectures.
  * Fixed imon for devfs. closes:#109609

isdnutils (1:3.1pre1b-18) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added ia64 to the list of architectures for all packages.
    It builds, so ship it :-)  Seriously, I see no reason why it shouldn't
    work.
  * Hacked a string in vbox/src/{log.c,vbox.c} that might be interpreted as a
    trigraph.  I hate trigraphs.
  * Added some #include <stdlib.h> to the cdb*.c files to declare exit() etc.
  * Fixed screwup in ipppd/auth.c related to dereferencing network IP number
    as a pointer to an uint32_t. Yuck. Also forwarded upstream to PPP people.
  * Fixed isdnlog/tools/dest/makedest so that it doesn't output line numbers
    while processing the data, if stdout is not a TTY. This saves space in
    the buildlog... Ditto for isdnlog/tools/zone/mkzonedb.c
  * Added a missing endpwent() call which caused isdnlog to keep /etc/passwd
    open. Also closed stdout, stderr in isdnlog while I was at it.
  * Solved a potential problem when the vbox password contained a comma, which
    conflicted with the perl stuff... Also made a note in the debconf template
    that : shouldn't be used (as that's the field separator in the file)
  * Added mips, mipsel to list of supported architectures, as it apparently
    builds fine. closes:#109210
  * Updated rate-nl.dat to reflect new NL rates (duh)

isdnutils (1:3.1pre1b-17) unstable; urgency=high

  * Urgency high, as this fixes a grave bug (segv in pppd), and should
    allow it to (finally!) build on powerpc
  * Apparently the kernel source that's used needs to be configured first
    on powerpc, otherwise it will compile fine, but e.g. isdnctrl will use
    the wrong structs or so (at least, it can't access any data via ioctl).
    Thanks to Alain Schroeder <alain@parkautomat.net> for figuring this out.
  * Use gcc 3.0 on powerpc, otherwise the compiler segfaults when doing
    capi20. Also figured out by Alain.
  * symlink libcapi20.so to libcapi20.so.2 . closes:#108013
  * in xmonisdn/Makefile.in, build target xmonisdn.man before xmonisdn.
    Don't ask why; since XFree 4.1.0 this is needed?!
    Also removed if statement from rules, as that somehow always was evaluated
    to false in sid environment (not in testing, where it was always true!)
    closes:#107902
  * "FIRMWARE=$firmware" should have been "firmware=$firmware" in
    isdnutils.postinst . Now it is. Also move firmware.conf out of the way if
    debconf now tells us there's no firmware to be loaded. Partly bug #107842
  * In isdnutils.postinst, remove bogus "none," prefix from firmware value
    stored in debconf. This is caused by the wrong debconf template before
    version -11. Other part of 107842, hence: closes:#107842
  * Made the hisaxctrl manpage a bit clearer about devfs and firmware.
  * Enclosed the $oldpwd in   cd $oldpwd   in quotes (in init.d.functions),

isdnutils (1:3.1pre1b-16) unstable; urgency=high

  * Urgency high, as this fixes two important bugs (ash and devfs related).
  * Filename for ippp device as passed to ipppd in init.d.functions didn't
    cope with devfs. closes:#107715
  * Dotting in a shell code fragment needs the file to either be in PATH or
    the filename to contain a slash. This is another one of those special
    features of ash that has been inflicted upon us. closes:#107745
  * Determining the linux source dir was screwed up for hurd.
  * Fixed instances of "echo -e"; now it's "/bin/echo -e" which always
    understands -e (ash's echo used to, now it doesn't; and it's not in
    POSIX).
  * Added powerpc again, as someone again managed to inflict some RC bugs on
    isdnutils preventing the previous version from entering testing. I've
    found that powerpc can't compile the capi20 code, so powerpc will have to
    do without all capi-related packages. The main stuff can go in though.
    BREAKING NEWS: according to Alain Schroeder <alain@parkautomat.net>, it
    compiles fine on powerpc when using gcc 3.0. He's volunteering to build
    the powerpc stuff for now, kudos to him!

isdnutils (1:3.1pre1b-15) unstable; urgency=high

  * Removed powerpc from architecture list, as apparently powerpc isn't able
    to compile isdnutils since end of 1999; and it's now holding up isdnutils
    from entering testing (which sucks). (The problem is a internal compiler
    error, hence not isdnutils' fault nor under isdnutils' control.)
  * Urgency "high", as the previous version was only held up by powerpc;
    no other problems nor no other changes, so I'd like isdnutils into
    testing ASAP.

     setup the connection'
  * Updated ipppd (auth.c) to current CVS:
    'loop never executed - this was the reason that droping a slave could
     remove the complete ip setup'
  * Build failed to properly find / unpack kernel sources. The way that is done
    is now changed (and the link is made in the package source's top dir, not
    in the parent dir). If the kernel source link is not properly made, the
    build should stop at once, instead of limping along...  closes:#106713
  * Install a symlink from vboxcnvt to rmdtovbox as well (the rmdtovbox manpage

  * isdnvboxserver will now always configure /var/spool/vbox/ttyI* as the

    makes it all a bit more logical. This also means that the postinst has to
    check for all possible old situations, and try to clean it up.

  * dot-include /usr/share/debconf/confmodule at the top of the isdnutils
    postinst, as having that done later on by the #DEBHELPER# code fucks the
    system. closes:#100704
  * Priority reverted to 'extra' as only the "isdnutils" package is marked as
    "optional" in the overrides, all the other packages are "extra" ?! Only
    the isdnutils package itself is now "optional"...
  * updated config.guess and config.sub scripts in capi20/ and isdnlog/client/
    to satisfy simple-minded test by hppa build daemon (those parts aren't
    architecture: any and wouldn't be built anyway on hppa). closes:#105035
  * Added german translations to isdnlog.templates,
    courtesy of Sebastian Feltel <sebastian@feltel.de>. closes:#102095
  * Updated to latest CVS (isdnlog.h, divertctrl, FAQ). I patched divertctrl.c
    to accomodate 2.2 kernels during building.
  * Makefile for imontty now uses configured location of kernel include files.
    Ditto for {xmonisdn,xisdnload}/Makefile.in
  * Added "Replaces: isdnutils(<<1:3.1pre1b-0)" to isdnutils-xtools, ipppd,
    isdnlog, isdnvboxclient, isdnvboxserver, libcapi20, and isdnactivecards.
    This should prevent upgrade of isdnutils removing the newly installed
    /usr/sbin/ipppd (for example, most apparent example) which was installed
    when the new package ipppd was installed earlier...  Hopefully this should
    prevent a *lot* of very strange bug reports.

isdnutils (1:3.1pre1b-10) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixed (upstream) bug in isdnctrl which prevented dialout etc.
  * isdnutils: further debashified init.d.functions and device.DEVICE.
    closes:#95716
  * isdnutils: added support for loading of ISAR.BIN in isdnutils init.d
    script, and include ISAR.BIN in isdnutils package instead of
    isdnactivecards.  closes:#93403,#89885
  * isdnutils: check in postinst whether vboxgetty is configured into inittab,
    and if so, whether isdnvboxserver is installed. If not, then give a
    warning. This is part 1 of bug #84031. I hate bug reports with multiple
    hardly-related bugs in one.
  * isdnutils: enhanced the HOWTO with suggestions by Matthias Berse
    <matthias.berse@ruhr-uni-bochum.de> with guide on setting up a simple
    connection to the internet. Hopefully it's a little less confusing now.
    closes:#70852
  * isdnutils: added comments to device.DEVICE and HOWTO about default route
    also being set in /etc/ppp/ip-{up,down}.d/*-ipppd and how to avoid that
    if you don't want that feature.  closes:#66854
  * ipppd: "Suggest:" dnrd as that works fine with ipppd to provide support
    for dynamic DNS servers.
  * isdnvboxserver: offer the possibility of skipping debconf configuration
    for those that prefer to do it by hand (or who already have a working
    config from pre-debconf versions). This is part 2 of bug #84031
  * isdnvboxserver: chown the spooldir to the right user. (The client user
    was used, not the daemon user. The client user does not have to exist
    as a real user.) This is part 3 and the final part of bug #84031, so
    closes:#84031
  * isdnvboxserver: vbox examples weren't included in the package.
    closes:#98048
  * isdnvboxclient: replace /dev/fd/0 with - in vboxplay for aplay (which
    understands - to mean stdin, although that's not documented in the manpage)
    closes:#85455
  * isdnvboxclient: make vboxbeep sound more distinctive, and ignore filenames
    starting with '.'. Thanks to Norbert Nemec <nobbi@cheerful.com>.
    closes:#87771
  * Kernel 2.4 is supported already. closes:#72834
  * isdnutils-xtools: xmonisdn now runs the xmonisdn-netup and -netdown
    commands with a "start" and "stop" parameter, as per manpage. closes:#80951
  * Priority changed to 'optional' to agree with the overrides.
  * The build now longer needs the /proc/self/fd/0 hack for reading from stdin,
    the tools have been modified to understand "-". Apparently on ARM there is
    no /proc/self/fd/0 ?!

isdnutils (1:3.1pre1b-9) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixed build problems on big-endian systems. Hopefully it also functions
    correctly :-)  closes:#89361
  * Reverted to using supplied freecdb code instead of debian package.
  * Updated isdnctrl, isdnlog, pppdcapiplugin, FAQ to current CVS version
    (no other changes in CVS).
  * Screwed up with the kernel source package thing, so source wasn't available
    if not somewhere in /usr/src or /usr/local/src already. closes:#91921
  * Changed the /dev/fd/0 to /proc/self/fd/0 . Apparently /dev/fd/* aren't
    always available (it wasn't on my sparc, installed from the Official
    cdroms), and it seems to confuse the hell out of a lot of people (they
    think the floppy is used :-)
  * Removed cui reference from ttyI(4) manpage. closes:#99609
  * Fixed /etc/isdn/init.d.functions to handle starting isdnlog with devfs.
  * Ignore errors from 'killall vboxgetty' in isdnvboxserver postinst.
  * Upgrading now no longer stops (and starts) anything via the init.d script.
    closes:#81519
  * Hopefully, upgrading from old 3.0-20 version to the current split version
    where ipppd is a separate package will now warn if ipppd is configured but
    not selected as a package. closes:#81517
  * Build-Depends tcl-dev changed to tcl8.3-dev, as the virtual package tcl-dev
    seems to have all but disappeared. Also updated xlib6g-dev to xlibs-dev,
    and kernel-source-2.2.19. libxaw-dev and libreadline4-dev added.
  * upgraded standards-version to 3.5.5

isdnutils (1:3.1pre1b-8) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fix "isdnutils status" with 2.4 kernels. closes:#89859,#89250
  * Add xutils to build dependencies. closes:#88100
  * Now include README.MPPP with the ipppd package. closes:#88911
  * Build-depend on kernel-headers-2.2.19pre17 (for now), closes:#86481

 -- Paul Slootman <paul@debian.org>  Mon, 26 Mar 2001 16:55:02 +0200

isdnutils (1:3.1pre1b-7) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Added debconf to depends of isdnlog and isdnvboxserver. Oops.
  * Bring interface up before adding routes to it when using MPPP.
    Thanks to Karl Erik Oyoygard for finding this.

 -- Paul Slootman <paul@debian.org>  Mon, 26 Feb 2001 09:39:48 +0100

isdnutils (1:3.1pre1b-6) unstable; urgency=low

  * isdnlog postinst still looked in /usr/share/doc/isdnutils/ for its
    example files. closes:#87399

 -- Paul Slootman <paul@debian.org>  Sun, 25 Feb 2001 15:34:21 +0100

isdnutils (1:3.1pre1b-5) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Fixed isdnrep to preserve the rest when called with -d. The old version
    deleted ALL data, yuck. Grave bug. closes:#83122
  * Separate pppdcapiplugin package (by popular request).
  * Changed ipppd.DEVICE example file, esp. the proxyarp line. closes:#69233
  * Fixed ipppd so that "noipx" option doesn't turn it ON. closes:#70416
  * Added "nohostroute" as option for ipppd yet again (sigh).
  * Fixed libcapi20 section (now in libs (of course)).
  * Updated most of it to the current CVS version.
  * Don't call hisaxctrl when starting isdnlog if cardid is capidrv-*
    (e.g.  with avmb1 module).
  * Added "MAKEDEV capi" to isdnactivecards.postinst.
  * Check for both /dev/isdninfo and /dev/isdn/isdninfo in init.d.functions,
    for devfs purposes. closes:#81368
  * Still got a bug report about isdnutils being installed without ipppd,
    despite the test in isdnutils.preinst. Now also look for ipppX interfaces
    (with netstat -i) in case people use non-standard isdn configs. Also added
    some debugging stuff in that script to help diagnose the problem when it
    goes wrong again.
  * Move the example scripts from /usr/share/doc/*/examples/default/ to
    /usr/share/isdn/default/ . closes:#85976
  * Fix init.d.functions to preserve any routes over a specific interface when
    adding a slave device to it (the interface had to be 'down" to add a slave,
    and that makes the kernel delete any routes that used that interface).
    closes:#85981
  * Run ipmasq (again) (if available) after configuring / deconfiguring the
    interfaces in the init script. closes:#69593
  * Check for old /etc/ppp/ip-{up,down}.d/{00,99}-isdnutils files, and either
    copy them to {00,99}-ipppd in the ipppd.preinst, or tell the user to check
    those files if {00,99}-ipppd already exist. Also nag in init.d.functions .
  * Replaced bashisms from /etc/isdn/init.d/functions.
  * Replaced some instances of tempnam() with more secure temp file usage.
  * Fixed having dh_installinit-supplied scripting added twice. Motto:
    don't use -ppackage when -a is already in effect.
  * Added manpage for vbox command.

 -- Paul Slootman <paul@debian.org>  Sun, 18 Feb 2001 19:06:24 +0100

isdnutils (1:3.1pre1b-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added experimental MPPP setup configuration (see README.MPPP).
  * Split off the capi20 library into libcapi20, as there are separate CAPI
    applications starting to turn up that need the capi20 libs for compilation
    and execution.
  * isdnactivecards init.d script had an error. closes:#77295
  * isdnutils preinstall checks whether ipppd config files exist and whether
    ipppd has been selected for installation, to prevent ipppd from
    disappearing while doing apt-get dist-upgrade. Something similar should
    probably be done for the other split-off packages, however ipppd is the
    most critical... (related to bug 65134)
  * update of isdn.conf didn't go right when upgrading from 3.0. 
  * Don't include the old isdn.conf example in doc/isdnlog/examples/default/
    anymore, the other ones from upstream are better nowadays.
  * Fetch defaults for debconf in isdnlog from current isdn.conf if it exists.
  * isdnvboxclient now is for any architecture, as it doesn't depend on ISDN
    hardware. Also don't make it depend on isdnutils; suggestion from
    dungeon.inka.de (Andreas Jellinghaus)
  * As there are now separate packages, one of which is for X utilities,
    this closes:#46433,#61831
  * Fix vbox documentation. Also noticed example/vboxd.conf wasn't being
    included in the (now) isdnvboxserver package, and example/vborxrc not in
    isdnvboxclient; oops... closes:#63700
  * Commenting out the "not configured" line in device.i* now also works, for
    those people who can't read instructions :-) closes:#70815
  * Updated rate-nl.dat and rate-de.dat
  * Removed old postinst stuff from original isdnutils from isdnutils-doc
    postinst.

 -- Paul Slootman <paul@debian.org>  Thu, 30 Nov 2000 23:49:18 +0100

isdnutils (1:3.1pre1b-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * First upload to unstable of the new isdnutils, after residing in
    experimental for a number of weeks. Most of the obvious bugs should
    be fixed now... Time for a larger audience to find the less obvious
    bugs :-)
  * capiinit now searches the correct directory for the firmware.
  * isdnactivecards now has a separate init.d script.
  * isdnvboxserver postinst could terminate due to exit code 30 from
    debconf, hopefully fixed now.

 -- Paul Slootman <paul@debian.org>  Wed, 18 Oct 2000 11:09:19 +0200

isdnutils (1:3.1pre1b-2) experimental; urgency=low

  * based on newest CVS version (2000-09-14). Now includes isdncause script.
  * Fixed up the control file, such as depends etc. and the sections.
  * Split isdnvbox into a server and a client part (isdnvboxserver and
    isdnvboxclient). An isdnvbox package remains for the time being that
    depends on both parts. This will go away when this stuff moves out of
    experimental.
  * First debconf attempt for isdnvboxserver.
  * Mark as conffiles /etc/isdn/vbox*
  * vbox messagefiles now are written with .vmsg extension, to facilitate
    handling via MIME.
  * default location for vbox.conf is now ~user/.vbox.conf instead of
    /var/spool/vbox/user/vbox.conf
  * Changed configuration to include capiinit (for isdnactivecards). This was
    missing in the previous versions...
  * Build-depend on tcl-dev instead of tcl8.0-dev|tcl8.2-dev|tcl8.3-dev ...
  * Fixed doc-base files.
  * Removed Yahoo Online from isdn.conf.de, apparently not usable anymore.
  * Fixed a lot of little things already reported as bugs. Not closing now,
    as this is still destined for experimental. The bugs that would be closed
    are 65056, 65059, 65060, 65061, 65065 (Thanks for all these reports Joey :)

isdnutils (1:3.1pre1b-1.1) experimental; urgency=low

  * test version only, only official upload (hence the "NMU" number).
  * I've taken the newest upstream CVS version again, which included quite a
    lot of what was in isdnutils_3.1pre1b-1.diff.gz .
  * Fixed dependencies (I had forgotten the epoch)
  * Fixed isdnconfig to get its default files from the right places;
    also removed isdnlog stuff from it as isdnlog has its own debconf
    stuff now.
  * Re-implemented some "smart" stuff in vboxmail and vboxplay that I had
    added in the 3.0 series of isdnutils.

 -- Paul Slootman <paul@debian.org>  Fri,  8 Sep 2000 09:39:58 +0200

isdnutils (1:3.1pre1b-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * New upstream sources (CVS of 2000/08/01)
  * Completely new packaging, now based on debhelper. So expect bugs for the
    first couple of versions while fixes made in the old version slowly get
    reimplemented :-)
  * Split into different packages. This helps those e.g. who don't need/want
    the X libs installed, and is also a must now there are megabytes of
    country-specific data for isdnlog.
  * isdnlog should now be country-independent! World premiere of this code :-)
    (Before, isdnlog was compile-time configured for a country.)
  * First attempt at adding debconf support as well. isdnlog is fairly complete,
    ipppd should have a debconf thing to create ippp0 config.
