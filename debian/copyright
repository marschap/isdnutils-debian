Isdn4k-utils uses a config system:
It uses a very modified/mutilated version of the "dialog" utility
written by Savio Lam (lam836@cs.cuhk.hk). Savio is not responsible
for this script or the version of dialog used by this script.        
Portions of this script were borrowed from the original Configure
script. (by William E. Roadcap)
