The debian isdnutils source package originated from the cvs.isdn4linux.de
repository.

However, over the past year or so, some parts have migrated to another CVS
repository, namely cvs.isdn4linux.org. Those parts are the CAPI things:

- capi20
- capifax
- capiinfo
- rcapid

For now, I have merged these from cvs.isdn4linux.org into the isdnutils
source via the diff.  Perhaps at some stage, these will become their own
source package...
