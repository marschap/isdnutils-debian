isdnlog-data contains the data files that isdnlog uses to find city
names, calculate the cost of a call, etc.

Newer versions are available more often than the sources of the
isdnutils suite are released, at some time the data files will
be distributed separately, so that updates can be done sooner.
How this is going to work is not quite clear yet.
