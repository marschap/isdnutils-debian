Description: Most important ISDN-related packages and utilities
 Note that for an external ISDN adapter, you do NOT need this package or any of
 the related ones. This is only for use with an internal ISDN adapter.
 Choosing this package will select the most frequently used components.
 .
 The current version of isdnutils is split up into component packages, to make
 it easier to fine-tune what is installed; hardly anyone needs everything.
 However, it's not possible to automatically select what is needed 
 This is a dependency package to ease installation, and choosing this selects
 the most important new packages. After installation, this package can be
 safely removed.
 .
 The component packages selected by this are:
  isdnutils-base   basic set of ISDN utilities.
  ipppd            for networking over ISDN with syncPPP.
  isdnlog          for logging ISDN calls (and much more).
  isdnutils-xtools for X ISDN apps (currently only xisdnload and xmonisdn)
  isdnvboxserver   ISDN answering machine, things needed on the server system.
  isdnvboxclient   ISDN answering machine, client side (vbox).
 .
 Not selected (although dselect will suggest some) are:
  isdnutils-doc    for extensive documentation (basic docs are of course
                   included with each package).
  isdneurofile     file transfer over ISDN with the special eurofile protocol.
  capiutils        CAPI utilies.
  pppdcapiplugin   a plugin for the normal ppp daemon that uses CAPI to
                   communicate over ISDN.
  libcapi20-3      shared library package needed by CAPI applications (will be
                   selected automatically when needed).
  libcapi20-dev    libcapi20 development files.
  isdnactivecards  firmware for mostly active ISDN cards, and other related
                   tools.

Description: ISDN utilities, the basic (minimal) set
 These utilities are the basic set of ISDN utilities that you need when you
 have an ISDN card installed. For complete functionality comparable to the
 old isdnutils package, you also need the following packages:
 .
  ipppd            for networking over ISDN with syncPPP
  isdnlog          for logging ISDN calls (and much more)
  isdnutils-xtools for X ISDN apps (currently only xisdnload and xmonisdn)

  isdnvboxclient   ISDN answering machine, client side (vbox)

Description: ISDN utilities that use X
 These are the graphical utilities for ISDN, xmonisdn and xisdnload.
 They provide, each in their own way, a visual indication of the status of
 the ISDN lines, so that it is directly obvious when there is a connection,
 for example.
 .
 This has been separated out of the main isdnutils package so that if you
 don't run X but do need ISDN, you don't have to include the X libraries
 unnecessarily.

Description: ISDN connection logger
 isdnlog logs all ISDN connections, and can calculate the cost of calls. If
 sufficient data is available, it can even recommend which alternate carrier
 would have been cheaper for a given call. For countries where calls are charged
 per discrete unit, it can disconnect the line just before the next unit starts.

Package: isdnlog-data

 All data related to call pricing, area codes, etc. in various countries.
 Really only useful when used with isdnlog.

Description: ISDN answering machine, client and server

 This package is a helper to install both the client (with which you listen to
 the messages) and the server (with which the messages are recorded) parts of
 the software.

Description: ISDN answering machine, client
 Let your Debian system be your answering machine! Messages can be accessed
 remotely, automatically emailed, etc.
 .
 This is the client part of the software, with which you can listen to the
 messages. Those messages are recorded on a system with the server part of
 the software (isdnvboxserver); that system may be elsewhere, as long as
 it can be connected to via a network.

 This is the server part of the software. This is what needs to be installed
 on the system with the ISDN card. To actually listen to the recorded messages
 you need the client package (isdnvboxclient) somewhere, not necessarily on
 the same system.

Description: Utilities for CAPI-capable ISDN cards
 Some ISDN cards (notably the AVM active cards, and the AVM passive cards
 when using the proprietary drivers) are accessed via the CAPI interface.
 The package contains utilities to initialize and get information about
 these cards.

 If you have an ISDN card with which CAPI works, you may be able to use
 applications that use CAPI, e.g. a fax system. At this point, AVM cards can
 work with CAPI, as well as some active cards. For the AVM passive cards you
 need to visit the www.AVM.de website.

 If you need this package, it will be installed automatically via dependencies,
 no need to select it yourself.

 system, you need this package. Not used much outside of Germany I
 believe (and not much there either).
