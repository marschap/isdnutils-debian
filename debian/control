Description: ISDN utilities - dependency package
 This package depends on the most frequently used components for an
 ISDN system using an internal adapter; they are not required for an
 external adapter.
 .
 The isdnutils suite is split up into component packages, to make it
 easier to fine-tune what is installed; hardly anyone needs everything.
 However, it's not possible to select what is needed automatically. This
 dependency package just ensures the most important components are
 installed, and can be safely removed again once that is done.
 .
 The component packages involved are:
  * isdnutils-base:   the basic set of ISDN utilities;
  * ipppd:            for networking over ISDN with syncPPP;
  * isdnlog:          for logging ISDN calls (and much more);
  * isdnutils-xtools: graphical utilities (xisdnload and xmonisdn);
  * isdnvboxclient:   ISDN answering machine client;
  * isdnvboxserver:   ISDN answering machine server.
 .
 It also suggests the following optional extras:
  * capiutils:        CAPI utilities;
  * isdnutils-doc:    additional documentation;
  * pppdcapiplugin:   a CAPI plugin for the normal PPP daemon.

Description: ISDN utilities - minimal set
 This package provides the basic set of ISDN utilities needed to make use
 of an ISDN card. For more complete functionality, install the isdnutils
 dependency package.

Description: ISDN utilities - graphical tools
 This package provides xmonisdn and xisdnload, which are graphical tools
 for ISDN. Each in its own way gives a visual indication of the status of
 the ISDN lines, so that (for example) it is obvious when there is a
 connection.
 .
 They have been split out into a separate package to allow the others
 in the suite to avoid dependencies on the X Window System.

 Point Protocol daemon needed to connect to the Internet through an
 internal ISDN card. It also supports dial-in connections from Windows
 clients.

Description: ISDN utilities - connection logger
 This package provides a set of utilities that can log ISDN connections and
 calculate the cost of calls. If sufficient data is available, it can even
 recommend which alternate carrier would have been cheaper for a given call.
 For countries where calls are charged per discrete unit, it can disconnect
 the line just before the next unit starts.

Package: isdnlog-data

Description: ISDN utilities - connection logger data
 This package provides data related to call pricing, area codes, etcetera,
 in various countries, and is only useful with isdnlog.

Description: ISDN utilities - answering machine dependency package
 Let your Debian system be your answering machine! Messages can be accessed
 remotely, automatically emailed, etc.
 .
 This package depends for convenience on both the vbox server (with which
 the messages are recorded) and the client (with which you listen to them).

Package: isdnvboxclient

Suggests: isdnvboxserver
Description: ISDN utilities - answering machine client
 Let your Debian system be your answering machine! Messages can be accessed
 remotely, automatically emailed, etc.
 .
 This package provides the vbox client, with which you can listen to the
 messages recorded by a vbox server (either running on the same machine or
 accessible over the network).

Package: isdnvboxserver

Description: ISDN utilities - answering machine server
 Let your Debian system be your answering machine! Messages can be accessed
 remotely, automatically emailed, etc.
 .
 This package provides the vbox server, which must be installed on the
 system with the ISDN card. To actually listen to the recorded messages
 you need the client package (isdnvboxclient) somewhere, not necessarily on
 the same system.

Section: net
Description: ISDN utilities - tools for CAPI-capable cards
 Some ISDN cards (notably the AVM active cards, and the AVM passive cards
 when using the proprietary drivers) are accessed via the CAPI interface.
 The package contains utilities to initialize and get information about
 these cards.

Description: ISDN utilities - CAPI support libraries
 If you have an ISDN card with which CAPI works, you may be able to use
 CAPI-capable applications such as fax systems. At this point, AVM cards can
 work with CAPI, as well as some active cards. For the AVM passive cards you
 need to visit the www.AVM.de website.
 .
 This package will be installed automatically if needed.

 on such cards.
