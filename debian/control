Description: ISDN utilities - dependency package
 This package depends on the most frequently used components for an
 ISDN system using an internal adapter; they are not required for an
 external adapter.
 .
 The isdnutils suite is split up into component packages, to make it
 easier to fine-tune what is installed; hardly anyone needs everything.
 However, it's not possible to select what is needed automatically. This
 dependency package just ensures the most important components are
 installed, and can be safely removed again once that is done.
 .
 The component packages involved are:
  * isdnutils-base:   the basic set of ISDN utilities;
  * ipppd:            for networking over ISDN with syncPPP;
  * isdnlog:          for logging ISDN calls (and much more);
  * isdnutils-xtools: graphical utilities (xisdnload and xmonisdn);
  * isdnvboxclient:   ISDN answering machine client;
  * isdnvboxserver:   ISDN answering machine server.
 .
 It also suggests the following optional extras:
  * capiutils:        CAPI utilities;
  * isdneurofile:     for file transfer over the EUROFILE protocol;
  * isdnutils-doc:    additional documentation;
  * pppdcapiplugin:   a CAPI plugin for the normal PPP daemon.

Description: ISDN utilities - graphical tools
 This package provides xmonisdn and xisdnload, which are graphical tools
 for ISDN. Each in its own way gives a visual indication of the status of
 the ISDN lines, so that (for example) it is obvious when there is a
 connection.

 They have been split out into a separate package to allow the others
 in the suite to avoid dependencies on the X Window System.

Description: ISDN utilities - connection logger
 This package provides a set of utilities that can log ISDN connections and
 calculate the cost of calls. If sufficient data is available, it can even
 recommend which alternate carrier would have been cheaper for a given call.
 For countries where calls are charged per discrete unit, it can disconnect
 the line just before the next unit starts.

 messages recorded by a vbox server (either running on the same machine or
 accessible over the network).

 This package provides the vbox server, which must be installed on the
 system with the ISDN card. To actually listen to the recorded messages
 you need the client package (isdnvboxclient) somewhere, not necessarily on
 the same system.
