These are the graphical utilities for ISDN, xmonisdn and xisdnload.
They provide, each in their own way, a visual indication of the status of
the ISDN lines, so that it is directly obvious when there is a connection,
for example.

This has been separated out of the main isdnutils package so that if you
don't run X but do need ISDN, you don't have to include the X libraries
unnecessarily.
