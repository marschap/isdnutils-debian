isdnutils for Debian
--------------------

This is a completely new packaging of the ISDN utilities collection.
isdnutils has now also been split up into different packages:

- isdnutils
  Compatibility package for people upgrading from the previous version.
  It depends on most of the split-off packages so that functionality
  isn't lost when upgrading.
  When in doubt, install this, and the rest will be installed as well :-)

- isdnutils-base
  The base part, containing direct kernel support, e.g. isdnctrl

- ipppd
  Needed for connecting via syncPPP to e.g. an ISP

- pppdcapiplugin
  If you have a CAPI-capable ISDN card, you can use this with the "normal"
  PPP daemon to make a connection over ISDN instead of using ipppd.

- isdnlog
  For logging ISDN connections, and optionally triggering actions upon events

- isdnlog-data
  Areacode, zone and cost info for isdnlog

- isdnutils-xtools
  programs that use X, such as xisdnload

- isdnvbox
  answering machine.  This is a dummy package that depends on the server
  and the client packages, so that both are installed when this package
  is selected.

- isdnvboxserver
  server part of the answering machine. This is the part that records the
  incoming calls.

- isdnvboxclient
  client part of the asnwering machine. This is the part that plays back
  the recorded messages. Note that this package can also be installed on
  another system in the network!

- isdnactivecards
  utilities and firmware for active cards. Not needed by most people.

- isdneurofile
  Transfer files using "eurofile" protocol. Somewhat experimental
