This is the README file for the "isdn4k-utils" package from Fritz Elfert.

This package contains utilities for the kernel ISDN-subsystem and some
contributions, mainly for monitoring ISDN-activities.

System prerequisites:

  To use this package, you need a kernel with an ISDN-subsystem configured.
  To get a such a kernel, take a clean standard-kernel and apply the
  appropriate isdn-patch, just like a normal kernel-patch. Then configure
  and build the kernel as usual.

  isdn-patches are available at

     ftp.franken.de:/pub/isdn4linux/v2.0

  For using modularized parts of the ISDN-subsystem, modules-1.3.57 or
  newer is strongly recommended.

3. Configuration, Compilation.

   Edit the toplevel-Makefile and change the definitions for
   KERNELDIR and MANDEST according to your local environment.

   Run "make"

   This builds all utilities except the TclTk-script "isdnmon"

4. Installation

   a) Create the device-inodes:

     make devices

   b) Install the utilities in /sbin:

     make install

   c) Install the manpages

   Note: the vbox-1.0 utility has to be configured by hand. Therefore
         it is not build automatically.

5. Application

   The directory ./etc contains an example startup-script which gets
   not installed automatically, because it MUST BE CONFIGURED IN ANY
   CASE! Please don't try to connect to the Internet without setting
   your own IP-addresses. This script is intended to be used with
   the modularized version of the ISDN-subsystem. Refer to the
   Documentation/isdn subdirectory of your kernel-sourcetree for
   more information on configuring Lowlevel drivers.

   For the utilities "isdnctrl", "icnctrl" and "telesctrl" refer to
   the manpages. For the other contributed utilities, look into their
   subdirectories for Documentation.
